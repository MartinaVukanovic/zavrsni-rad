This project was created as part of my final thesis for the topic of the same name "Visualization of graph search algorithms using the JavaScript programming language". It is a simple web page that consists out of a few parts. 

The first part of the developed web page, has three buttons, space for displaying graph steps and the initial graph itself. By clicking on the first button that the user sees, the steps of the algorithm are displayed one by one with an interval of 750 milliseconds.

![firstPart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49649259/190352629-49c04429-6337-463e-aa48-f6124fe6c715.gif)

Another set of buttons enables users to go through steps of algorithm at their own pace and also enables going through algorithm backwards if needed.

![secondPart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49649259/190493019-c3f485bf-9835-4a37-9bd6-12fb00a486c0.png)

Second part displays the algorithm used for shortest path finding and general steps of that algorithm. Also, on the right we can se calculated shortest path with description of all edges in that path and overall weight of that path.

![thirdPart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49649259/190492902-bdec7f84-a43a-4a95-b5ca-c9170d1f3860.png)

The last part of the developed web page consists of a table and a couple of forms that help us in dynamism and personalization of the graph itself on which we can later display the steps of the algorithm.
